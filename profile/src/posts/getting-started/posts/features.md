Farmassist is a comprehensive smart farming ecosystem equipped with a range of features to enhance agricultural productivity and efficiency. Here's a closer look at its key features:

- [Farm Management Subsystem](#farm-management): Users can view agricultural news and manage planting and harvesting data.
- [IoT Monitoring Subsystem](#iot-monitoring): Users can view IoT telemetry data from the farm in the form of charts and receive alert notifications for abnormal telemetry data.
- [Plant Disease Detection Subsystem](#plant-disease-detection): Users can take a picture of a diseased plant via camera to detect the disease type.

The backend services used are as follows:

- [Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/products/auth)
- [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/products/firestore)
- [Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database)
- [Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/products/functions)
- [Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/products/cloud-messaging)
- [Google Cloud AutoML Vision](https://cloud.google.com/automl)

The following sections explain more detail about the services and components used by the corresponding subsystems.

## Authentication and User Profile

The signup and login flow of Farmassist is developed using the [zustand](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand) library and Firebase Authentication. After a user signs up successfully, the user data will be stored in the data model of Cloud Firestore as shown below:

```text
{
  "users": { // "users" collection
    "4lbwvicymz71LfY9POHZ": { // "userId" document
      "id": "4lbwvicymz71LfY9POHZ",
      "email": "example@farmassist.com",
      "displayName": "Jack",
      "tokens": [ ... ] // used by Cloud Messaging
    },
    "4DkFgqNdjZnEh78YmsE3": { ... },
    // more "userId" documents
  }
}
```

## Farm Management

Cloud Firestore, a NoSQL, document-oriented database, is used to store farm management data using key-value pairs. In Cloud Firestore, each collection consists of a number of documents in which each document can store a number of subcollections.

There are 2 types of farm management data stored: **planting data** and **harvesting data**. An example of the data model for harvesting data is shown below:

```text
{
  "planting": { // "planting" collection
    "4lbwvicymz71LfY9POHZ": { // "userId" document
      "months": { // "months" subcollection
        "jan": { // "jan" document
          "plantName": "tomato",
          "noOfPlants": "100",
          "plantDate": "25-03-2021",
          "estimatedHarvestWeek": "9",
          "harvestDate": "25-5-2021",
          "harvested": true
        },
        "feb": { ... } // "feb" document
        // more documents for the remaining months
      }
    },
    // more "userId" documents
  }
}
```

Under farm management, 2 extra APIs are used:

- [News API](https://newsapi.org/docs/endpoints/top-headlines) is used to fetch top headlines for science category.
- [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current) is used to obtain weather data of the farm location.

## IoT Monitoring

Realtime Database acts as a repository of IoT telemetry data that performs data synchronization with the Farmassist app. The overall process of IoT monitoring is described as follows:

1. When new telemetry data is stored in Realtime Database, Cloud Functions will be triggered.
2. Cloud Functions execute a function to check for abnormal values in the received telemetry data.
3. If abnormal values exist, Cloud Functions will call Cloud Messaging service to send an alert notification to the relevant app user, which is identified by a unique token.

5 types of telemetry data are stored as JSON objects in Realtime Database:

- Air Humidity (%)
- Air Temperature (Â°C)
- Soil Moisture (%)
- Soil pH (pH)
- Soil Salinity (Millisiemens/cm)

Each telemetry data is stored as a key-value pair of timestamp and value. An example of the data model for telemetry data is shown below:

```text
{
  "telemetry_data": {
    "4lbwvicymz71LfY9POHZ": { // userId
      "humidity": {
        "1617979596947": "56.64", // timestamp: value
        "1617979596949": "55.89",
        // more values
      },
      "moisture": { ... },
      "pH": { ... },
      "salinity": { ... },
      "temperature": { ... }
    },
    // more telemetry data from other users
  }
}
```

For demonstration purpose, a minimal IoT device simulator is built to send telemetry data to Realtime Database. For more information, you can refer to [Farmassist IoT Device Simulator](https://github.com/Farmassist-CM/farmassist-iot-device-simulator).

>The code for Cloud Functions can be found in [Farmassist Firebase](https://github.com/Farmassist-CM/farmassist-firebase)The cloud functions has not yet been implmented or updated.

## Plant Disease Detection

A plant disease detection model was trained using Google Cloud AutoML Vision. The training dataset is a subset of [PlantVillage dataset from Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/tywbtsjrjv/1). A total of 2,941 diseased plant images that consists of 6 disease categories were used:

- Corn Common Rust (500 images)
- Corn Gray Leaf Spot (441 images)
- Potato Early Blight (500 images)
- Strawberry Leaf Scorch (500 images)
- Tomato Leaf Mold (500 images)
- Tomato Mosaic Virus (500 images)

After training, the model was exported as a [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) model, which is suitable to be run on a mobile device. You can find the trained model [here](/assets/model.tflite).

>The data set could be changes in the future updates to provide a more rubust alternative.
